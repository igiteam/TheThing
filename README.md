# Quake III Arena

A Quake III Arena port designed for running in vanilla JavaScript pre-ECMAScript 2015 (no WebAssembly). Simply open the link below, click the red icon, and select all the `PK3` files and `q3config.cfg` (optional); all files will be loaded and booted automatically. If you have the commercial version and you want to play it, you need to have the Point Release 1.32 version, this means than you need to have and select at least the following files: `pak0.pk3`, `pak1.pk3`, `pak2.pk3`, `pak3.pk3` and `pak4.pk3`. The multiplayer mode is not available in this project, for multiplayer check the original project link at the bottom of this document.

```js
embedQuake3({

## Main differences with the original project:

- Removed CDN dependency.
- Removed cache flow in the LocalStorage.
- Fixed build so it can handle PK3 files dynamically.
- Fixed build so it can handle big files (the commercial version).
